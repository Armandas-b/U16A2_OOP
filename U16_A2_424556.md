This application is meant to demonstrate GUI(Graphical User Interface).
Requirements:

- [ ] Creating, Deleting tasks
- [ ] Tracking state, and allowing user to change state(Complete, Incomplete)
- [ ] Support for titles, descriptions, due dates(mutable), completion comments
- [ ] Displaying tasks in a list
- [ ] Filtering tasks by state

#### 2. Index System

This application is meant to demonstrate the use of a database.

Requirements:

- [ ] The program should be able to read a CSV file
- [ ] Generate unique index reference for each item
- [ ] Write the entry to a new CSV file
- [ ] A separate class responsible for allocation of serial numbers as an interface to allow alternative future implementations

### B. Design

#### **1. Todo List**

**a. Problem summary:**

The problem is to develop a Todo List application that allows users to create, delete, and manage tasks. The application should support features like tracking the completion status of tasks, setting due dates, and displaying a list of tasks. Users should be able to toggle between displaying all tasks or only incomplete tasks.

**b. Complexity:**

The complexity of the problem is moderate. It involves managing task data, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and providing user-friendly interactions.

**c. Constraints:**

- Task should have properties like title, description, due date, completion status, and completion comments
- Users should be able to modify task details like: title, description, due date, completion status, and completion comments

**d. Intended users:**

The intended users are people who want to manage their tasks. The application should be easy to use and provide a good user experience.

**e. Required Interactivity:**

The Todo List application should provide the following interactivity:

- Creating new tasks by entering task details.
  
- Deleting tasks from the list.
  
- Tracking the completion status of tasks.
  
- Modifying task properties such as title, description, due date, and completion status.
  
- Displaying a list of tasks with filtering options to toggle between all tasks and incomplete tasks.

**f. Use case diagram:**

#### **Data Dictionary - Todo List:**

1. Data structures:

- Task:
  
  - title: string
  
  - description: string

  - due_date: date
  
  - completion_status: boolean
  
  - completion_comments: string

- TaskList: A collection (List) of Task objects

2. UI:

- CreateTask: A button which creates an empty task and adds it to the TaskList

- InputTaskDetails: A form which allows users to enter task details(title, description, due date, completion status, and completion comments)

- DeleteTask: A button which deletes the selected task from the TaskList

- ModifyTask: A button which allows users to modify the selected task

- FilterTasks: A button which allows users to toggle between displaying all tasks and displaying only incomplete tasks

3. Data Storage:

- TaskList: A collection (List) of Task objects stored in memory during runtime

- Implementation of persistance storage is out of scope for this project

#### **2. Index System:**

**a. Problem summary:**

The problem is to develop an Index System application that allows users to generate unique index references for items. The application should support features like reading a CSV file, generating unique index references, and writing the entries to a new CSV file.

**b. Complexity:**

The complexity of the problem is moderate. It involves reading data from a CSV file, generating unique index references, and writing the indexed data to a new CSV file.

**c. Constraints:**

- The book details are stored in a CSV file without headings.
  
- The index references should be unique for each book.

**d. Intended users:**

The intended users are the staff or administrators of the college library responsible for managing book indexing.

**e. Required Interactivity:**

The Index System application should provide the following interactivity:

- Reading book details from a CSV file.

- Generating unique index references for each book.

- Writing the indexed data to a new CSV file.

**f. Use case diagram:**

![Use case diagram](use_case_diagram_2.png)

#### **Data Dictionary - Index System:**

1. Data structures:

- Book:
  - Properties:
    - Name: string
    - Title: string
    - Place published: string
    - Publisher: string
    - Date of publication: date
    - Index reference: string

2. Control structures:

- CSVReader: A class which reads data from a CSV file and returns a list of Book objects
  
- SerialNumberAllocator: A class which implements an interface to allocate serial numbers
  
- CSVWriter: A class which writes data to a CSV file

3. Data Storage:

- Input CSV file: A CSV file containing book details(name, title, place published, publisher, date of publication)
- Output CSV file: A CSV file containing book details(name, title, place published, publisher, date of publication, index reference)

4. Pre-defined Code:

- CSV Parsing Library: Utilize a library or built-in functionality for parsing CSV files and extracting book details from the input file and writing book details to the output file.

### **Algorithm design - Todo List:**

**Pseudocode:**

```pseudo
START

// Initialize an empty task list
todoList = []

// Display the todo list
DISPLAY_TODO_LIST(todoList)

// User interaction loop

WHILE true
    action = PROMPT_USER_FOR_ACTION()
    
    IF action is "Add Task"
        taskDetails = PROMPT_USER_FOR_TASK_DETAILS()
        
        IF VALID_TASK_DETAILS(taskDetails)
            task = CREATE_TASK(taskDetails)
            todoList.ADD(task)
        ELSE
            DISPLAY_INVALID_INPUT_MESSAGE()
        
    ELSE IF action is "Modify Task"
        taskIndex = PROMPT_USER_FOR_TASK_INDEX(todoList)
        
        IF VALID_TASK_INDEX(taskIndex, todoList)
            modifiedTaskDetails = PROMPT_USER_FOR_MODIFIED_TASK_DETAILS(todoList[taskIndex])
            
            IF VALID_MODIFIED_TASK_DETAILS(modifiedTaskDetails)
                UPDATE_TASK(todoList[taskIndex], modifiedTaskDetails)
            ELSE
                DISPLAY_INVALID_INPUT_MESSAGE()
        ELSE
            DISPLAY_INVALID_INPUT_MESSAGE()
        
    ELSE IF action is "Delete Task"
        taskIndex = PROMPT_USER_FOR_TASK_INDEX(todoList)
        
        IF VALID_TASK_INDEX(taskIndex, todoList)
            todoList.REMOVE(taskIndex)
        ELSE
            DISPLAY_INVALID_INPUT_MESSAGE()
        
    ELSE IF action is "Mark Task as Complete"
        taskIndex = PROMPT_USER_FOR_TASK_INDEX(todoList)
        
        IF VALID_TASK_INDEX(taskIndex, todoList)
            todoList[taskIndex].SET_COMPLETED(true)
        ELSE
            DISPLAY_INVALID_INPUT_MESSAGE()
        
    ELSE IF action is "Toggle Display Mode"
        displayMode = PROMPT_USER_FOR_DISPLAY_MODE()
        
        IF VALID_DISPLAY_MODE(displayMode)
            todoList.SET_DISPLAY_MODE(displayMode)
        ELSE
            DISPLAY_INVALID_INPUT_MESSAGE()
        
    ELSE IF action is "Exit"
        BREAK
    
    DISPLAY_TODO_LIST(todoList)
END
```

### **Algorithm design - Index System:**

**Pseudocode:**

For the main program:

```pseudo
START
Read data from input CSV file
Initialize an empty book list

FOR EACH record in the input CSV file
    bookDetails = PARSE_RECORD(record)
    
    IF VALID_BOOK_DETAILS(bookDetails)
        indexReference = GENERATE_UNIQUE_INDEX_REFERENCE()
        combinedDetails = COMBINE_INDEX_REFERENCE_WITH_BOOK_DETAILS(indexReference, bookDetails)
        book = CREATE_BOOK(combinedDetails)
        bookList.ADD(book)
    ELSE
        DISPLAY_INVALID_RECORD_MESSAGE()
    
Add index number to each book in the book list

Write book list to output CSV file
Display success message
END


```

For the index reference generator:

```pseudo

FUNCTION GENERATE_UNIQUE_INDEX_REFERENCE():
    // Generate a unique index reference using a hashing algorithm
    timestamp = GET_CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()
    randomString = GENERATE_RANDOM_STRING(10) // Generate a random string
    
    // Combine the timestamp and random string
    dataToHash = CONCATENATE(timestamp, randomString)
    
    // Apply the hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256)
    hashedData = APPLY_HASH_ALGORITHM(dataToHash, "SHA-256")
    
    // Extract a portion of the hashed data as the index reference
    indexReference = GET_SUBSTRING(hashedData, 0, 8) // Extract the first 8 characters
    
    RETURN indexReference


```

## GUI Design

I need to design a GUI for the Todo List application. The GUI should allow users to perform the actions described in the use case diagram. The GUI should also display the current state of the task list.

### **GUI design - Todo List:**

**GUI Mockup:**

![GUI Mockup](gui_mockup_1.png)

**GUI Description:**

The GUI consists of the following components:

- A slide filter to filter tasks by their status (All, Active, Completed)

- A list of task with the following columns:
  - Task
  - Due Date
  - Edit
  - Delete
  - Mark as Complete
Each task will get strike-through text if it is completed.

- A field to enter a new task with buttons to set its due date, and add it to the task list
